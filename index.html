            <p>    
                I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Management in 2000 with over 15 years of work experience in accounting in various industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a beginner in the web developing field who wishes to build up a great amount of experience in a shorter amount
                of time.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I am looking to snowball my experience in web developing and to eventually become a software engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am predicting the web developing field to increase in complexity over the next 5 years and therefore plan on continually learning new skills to
                keep ahead of the curve.
            </p>
            <p>
                I Love excel and working with formulas and always researching for new methods to solve a problem with less resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always striving to be a productive team player and to work well with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a personality that is agreeable and never wanting confrontation with anyone but instead always cultivating mutually beneficial relationships.
            </p>
